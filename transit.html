            <p><!--J set us up with a doctor in Berlin.</br></br> -->
                There is a reason the flight from Paris to Pappeete (22 hours, mid-way landing in Vancouver for
                refueling) was so cheap - you have to take a Covid test before flying. If you’re positive, you’re out. The
                tests in Poland are a joke, so we took it as an excuse to see our Berlin friends for the first time since the
                pandemic started. <!-- With my hacker crowd, the talk of the moment was Julian’s extradition trial, and just
                how much all the witnesses are doing great and exposing the corruption of the prosecutors. Everyone
                agreed that none of it would matter though. Some of us still hold out hope for a win at the appeal. Some
                think he will die in a US prison. R proposed a vague plan of Risk-Limiting Audits for upcoming
                elections in both Bolivia and Ecuador, and proposed I get involved to handle the statistics. It’s a terrifying
                amount of responsibility but the math is not that complicated. (When I said that, J made a series of
                jokes about what it means when Eva says math is not complicated.) My Cambridge friends - most of
                whom also have been living in Berlin for the last decade are being "adults"... that is, buying houses and
                having children. Nora and Frank are, as everyone expected, terrific new parents. --> It all already felt much
                less hopeless than the Warsaw we left behind.</br></br>
                I imagine by the time anyone reads this, the Covid test will be a common enough experience
                that there is no need to describe it. Suffice to say, we passed. Despite some setbacks at Tegel airport
                we managed to get to Paris and board the flight to Papeete. At boarding, a flight attendant checked our
                test results, health declarations and temperature. And we were let onto a plane to paradise. Far away
                from world torn between an epidemic and recession, and fast approaching the fork in the road between
                revolution and genocide. There is none of that here. No, on the islands of South Pacific we are as far
                from these concerns as we can be. Eva and Brett, Pirates if the South Seas, tired of humanity’s bullshit.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    <img src="images/flight.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                  </p>
                
            <p>So anyhow, we've landed in Tahiti. It sounds pretty nuts, but we’re here.</br></br>
                We’re in the world’s navel. Time zone exactly 12 hours behind the one we departed. 
                The AirBnB is right at the western seaboard and we hear the roar of the waves all night. 
                The beach is black volcanic sand and the water is neon blue. We have this place for 5 weeks, 
                and plan to use it as a base to thoroughly explore Tahiti and Moorea, and then… who knows? 
                It was a one-way flight. We can stay in French Polynesia for up to 3 months. The internet is good enough that we can both work remotely. 
                Time zones are nuts though – an Ontario work day starts at 3AM for us. And today we bough a couple of inexpensive bikes, 
                and rode them back from Pappeete to Puna’Auia. They’re gonna get a lot of use in the coming months.
            </br></br>
                Now real talk: how is this actually doable. The pandemic has made a lot of traveling cheaper, but more risky. 
                So the flight from Paris was 800 euros, the AirBnB is 1000/month. Not bad. About 30% of what it would be in normal times. 
                But it’s a gamble – if you get a positive COVID test (or let an asshole airline worker delete your booking like what 
                happaned to us at Tegel when we didn't have the health declarations yet... 
                luckily an awesome AirFrance dude restored it once we got to Paris) you’re out and most of the money’s gone. 
                The gamble paid off for us though. On top of that, you have to remember that food costs are high here 
                – many products get shipped in thousands of miles. So we plan to cook our own food and buy local products as much as we can. 
                The initial trip to the supermarket ate 100 bucks for absolute basics – guess that’s comparable to a major Western city, and much cheaper than, say, Iceland.
            </br></br>
                We already feel like we’ve reclaimed 2020.</p>
