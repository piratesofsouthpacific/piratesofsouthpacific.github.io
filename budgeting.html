                    <h2>Budgeting in <b>Tahiti</b></h2>
                    <p>If you want to spend time in Tahiti at about the same cost as modest living in a major city, here's how to hack it. 
                    You find accomodations on http://www.petitesannonces.pf/, or, failing that, from an independent host on AirBnB. 
                    Booking an AirBnB for a month or longer will often get you much better rates. </br></br>
                    You cook your own food and take care to buy local products as much as you can - everything that is processed is shipped thousands of miles. 
                    Get ready to eat a lot of fruit, veggies and fish. Plus baguettes (every supermarket has them fresh every morning at about half a buck) and 
                    locally produced milk. It's pretty great. You'll learn to open coconuts in no time. You can get local produce delivered from 
                    https://tahiti-localfarms.com/. Every sunday there are street vendors all around the coast selling the best grilled meat you'll ever 
                    eat and lical <i>firi firi</i> donuts. Prices vary. In Puna-Auia we've been paying an equivalent of 5 dollars for a grilled piece of 
                    chicken with delicious sauce that's enough to feed us both, and 2 bucks for a bag of <i>firi firi</i> donuts, in Papenoo it was 5 for two 
                    fried chicken legs and <i>firi firi</i> altogether. 
                </br></br>According to the (very innacurate on many occasions Lonely Planet) guide, 
                    your options to get bikes are a 15-20 bucks a day rentals and that's pretty much it. 
                    What they don't mention is that if you're here for longer, buying a bike from Pacific Cycles in Papeete starts below 200 bucks.</br></br>
                    Public transit.The cost of bus travel depends on how far you go and is typically an equivalent of 1.5 to 3.5 dollars paid to the driver as you come in. Buses go in both directions around the island from Papeete, there is a stop for the buses going east to Puna'Auia and beyond is at 59 Av. du Maréchal Foch. For the buses going west in the direction of Papeno'o, go around the corner to the side of the Mairie on Rue du Père Collette.

                <h2>Travelling between islands</h2>
                <p>If Covid is over, you don't have to fly from island to island - the cargo ships take on passengers and they do it cheap. You can also send your stuff on these boats - show up to the office in the Papeete harbour with plenty of time to spare, there may be a line. On smaller islands lines are unlikely. We sent out bikes via Taporo VII as we flew to Huahine and it was super easy. <a href="https://www.outsidevibes.com/taking-cargo-boats-around-french-polynesia/">This post</a> has additional input about hitchhiking on cargo boats, but I'd take it with a grain of salt - the authors sound kinda bitter and like they had a pretty superficial experience of French Polynesia.</br></br>Between Moorea and Tahiti, there are regular ferries (the Aremiti is a solid choice) and if you travel with bikes, you get admitted via the vehicle deck and get to skip the passenger line. ;)</p>
            </br>	<h2>The <b>Lonely Planet guide to French Polynesia</b> is hilariously bad, and here are some of the things it gets wrong.</h2>
<p>1. Electric outlets. According to LP, they are all type A (North American). All that we've seen so far have been type C (European).</br>
2. Cost of travel. They seem to believe that "budget" travel would be 120 dollars per day per person. I'm sorry, what? That's fucking weak sauce, you can cut that in half, unless you're diving or island hopping every other day. See the budgeting tips above. 
I was particularly dissaponted with Lonely Planet on this one, because they built their brand on backpacker culture.</br> 3. Buses.  The travel guide says it's a flat fare of 2.5 and that it's paid at the end, and neither of these two things are true. Anyone else getting the impression it was written by bougie squares who never left resorts? </br> 4. Indigenous struggle. The guide pays very little attention to local affairs, and has a very white/francophone bias. The most reference to any Land Defender activity is on page 69 ("Inland Thrills"): "(...) at the time of research the road was closed further down the valley due to a barricade built by the area's residents. Legal proceedings were under way to ensure that the road would remain accessible both to visitors and Tahiti's hydroelectric company workers." CRINGE. 
</br> 5. None of the cultural references are actually Polynesian. The guide has a standard list of Hollywood movies about Polynesia for you to watch, but no reference to writers or creators that are actually Polynesian. Anyway, I'm just starting to read Chantal Spitz right now cause Wikipedia does a better job of this than Lonely Planet. And as for Hollywood movies, it's pretty on the nose that Moana (not mentioned in the guide, possibly because it came out too late?) also did a much better job of understanding Polynesian culture.
</br> 6. IT CLAIMS THERE ARE NO BEACHES IN RANGIROA. What the everlasting fuck. THERE ARE SO MANY BEACHES IN RANGIROA.
