                Sometime in mid-July 2010, a group of six merry backpackers rolled up to the Cambodian border 
                on a sweltering, third class Thai train, got promptly overcharged for visas by a collaboration of tuk tuk drivers and border guards, 
                and got on a bus to Siem Reap. Over all, we were only in Cambodia for a week. For me, it was enough to both fall in love with it and be very eager to get out. 
                My grandparents are thamselves survivors of genocide, but never before or after was I in a place where a tragic past and present are so obvious and visceral. 
                It hit me hard, extra hard, perhaps because of my own family's history. Memories good and bad have haunted me ever since.
            </br></br>

            </br></br>
                
                I'm not sure what I expected now by going back. I am, if anything, more sensitive, better informed, and more conscious. I think I hoped things are better now (huh?), and I was impressed with Cambodia's 
                ultra low Covid numbers, hoping they're real. I wanted Brett to experience Angkor, and this may be the only time in our lives when there are hardly any tourists. </br>
                And perhaps, I hoped I can do better as a tourist than I did before, somehow. Be better.
                I wanted to find Khmer Amok we used to eat every night in the same restaurant in Siem Reap and the <i>sticky rice</i>. 
                It doesn't mean what it does in Thailand. Here it is rice cooked in a bamboo stick.
                I wanted to experience Cambodia alive, without going to the Killing Fields (Brett is refusing to go and I get it.)
                Last time, we went to the Killing Fields and quietly left the country the following day. A couple of days before that, we went to the Tonle Sap floating market, and stopped in a village on the way, where
                landmine surviviors were going about their business and an old lady selling sticky rice out of an old bike had nothing to her name but that bike. For the last decade, I've regretted not buying her rice.

                Back then, I knew precious little about the recent situation in Cambodia. I had no idea that its corrupt dictator Hun Sen has been in power (by now) for nearly half a century by turning his cloak back and forth and throwing Cambodians under the bus 
                whenever it was expedient. I didn't know that the US had been arming the Khmer Rouge for decades, or Kissinger's role in destabilizing the region in the first place. I barely knew Pol Pot's real name.
                I was this twenty year old backpacker having the time of her life with her best friends. I wasn't even doing any of the planning and research for the trip, 
                Lisa did most of that. Now I know so much more, and part of me wishes I didn't. What the hell did I get myself into.

            <i>January 29th, Phnom Penh</i>
        </br></br>
        We flew into Phnom Penh from Bangkok on a Lanmei Airlines flight. For the first time ever, we saw flight attendants decked out in full PPE. 
        Land borders are closed, because of Covid. I would have preferred to come in from the West, it would have been more gentle. Upon landing, we were subjected to multiple
        documents checks and finally, after we picked up our bags, to a rapid Covid test. This was terrifying of course - especially after what happened with my test in Thailand. 
        I can't imagine going through that but in a Cambodian hospital.
        We were all asked to wait in the terminal as health workers would come out and read out our names after the tests, one by one, turned out negative. 
        Finally, we heard our names. We were free to go. </br></br>
        <img src="images/SEA/flight.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" style="width:49%">
        <img src="images/SEA/rat.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" style="width:49%">
        </br></br>
        Much like everything else - this is not entirely the Phnom Penh I remember. Hopefully, that means there is less abject poverty and exploitation, but that remains to be seen.
        On the way from the airport, we passed a Tesla outlet. Then a market selling smartphones on the cheap, according to the tuk tuk driver. 
        I knew (from Lisa) that the area we stayed in last time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeung_Kak">Boeung Kak lake</a> is no more. 
        It used to be a stunning, big lake in the middle of the city. There was a row of cheap hostels lining a coast, with parts of the buildings reaching on poles over the water, with hammocks and pillows. 
        When you exited the hostel, you were in a street where every establishment offered marijuana on the cheap. There were 1$ Long Island Ice Teas (the best you'll ever have - helluva kick and tasted like ice tea) and <i>happy pizzas</i> covered in weed. 
        We caught the last of it. The government had leased the entire area of the lake to a developer for 99 years for pennies. Shortly after we were there, people were evicted, the lake was filled with sand,
        and the entire area turned into a giant building site soon to be covered in condos. You may not be surprised that the development company belongs to a very well connected senator of the ruling party, Lao Meng Khin.</br>

        </figure></br>

        Our guesthouse had given away our booked and paid for room to someone who booked four nights rather than one, so to cheer ourselves up we upgraded to a better hotel, 
        overlooking the river. Then we spent most of our one day in Phnom Penh in the room, resting and hiding from touts. We were off to a great start, clearly.
</br></br>

        <i>January 31st, Siem Reap</i></br></br>

        <i>It looks really apocalyptic.</i></br>-B.
    </br></br>
    Yeah, it does. probably about two thirds of the establishments in Siem Reap must have gone bankrupt in the last two years. Most streets seem dead. Pub Street is putting on a good face,
    blasting music at inhuman (and insufferable) volumes, but even there some windows are shuttered. I hardly reckognized the Central Market in a dead, dark alley that had that vague market smell
    that seemed to be coming from some ghostly past dimension.
